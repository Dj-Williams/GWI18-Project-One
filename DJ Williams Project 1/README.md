# GWI18-Project-One

Welcome to my derpy space game! 

Press any directional arrow key to come out of warp, and avoid the asteroids! (Theres no way to lose/Win yet, so just enjoy the space aesthetic and retro pixel graphics!)

Things I wish I could've included in this "game", see my Trello Board [here](https://trello.com/b/LX6bAmeL/wdi-project-1-space-boi)
