# GWI18-Project-One

Welcome to my space game!

Press any directional arrow key to come out of warp, and avoid the asteroids! (Theres no way to lose/Win yet, so just enjoy the space aesthetic and retro pixel graphics!)

  When I was originally presented with project one, I was very inspired to attempt to create a side-scrolling space shooter using HTML 5 Canvas, and Phaser.js.

However, after multiple failed attempts to connect a working version of phaser to my file, I settled for working with vanilla HTML5 Canvas, JavaScript, and CSS.

Things I wish I could've included in this "game", see my Trello Board [here](https://trello.com/b/LX6bAmeL/wdi-project-1-space-boi)

All of my Hard Mode/Stretch Goals highlighted in red are what I would've liked to include in the game. I would've also have liked to use a game development library to make the process of making the game ALOT easier. It might not look like much, but I gave this game literally everything I had. I hope you get a little enjoyment from it.
